#summary Voice Events Documentation

=== Setting Up ===

You need to set up voice event controllers.  Begin by doing the following:

{{{
  script/generate voice_events_controller controller_name
}}}

This will generate two files.  app/voice_events/routes.rb is your event routing file.  Documentation on how to use it is in the file.  The first controller you set up will be the default.

The second file will be app/voice_events/controller_name_voice_events.rb.  Look inside this file for example events.  Calling params inside any of those functions will give you a hash of all the params sent by FreeSWITCH.  The function names must match the FreeSWITCH event names.  Voice events will then automatically subscribe to this event.

=== Running ===
Run with
{{{
  script/voice_events
}}}

You can also daemonize just like VoiceViews

{{{
  script/voice_events -a start -d
}}}

Inside of the events you have full access to your models and other rails functionalities.
